<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt><a href="http://localhost:8080/saaj-simple"><b>saaj-simple</b></a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This sample application demonstrates how to send a simple <code>SOAPMessage</code>
from a sender (servlet) to a receiver (servlet). This shows a simple
round-trip message; the receiver responds with a reply. The messages
appear in the directory from which you started the Web container.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://localhost:8080/saaj-book"><b>saaj-book</b></a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This sample Web application demonstrates how to create and
send a <code>SOAPMessage</code> from a sender (servlet) to a receiver
(servlet). This sample demonstrates how a DOM document can be used in
conjunction with SAAJ. A DOM document is created from information read
from an XML file, and the content is added to the body of a message.
The messages appear in the directory from which you started the Web
container.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://localhost:8080/saaj-translator"><b>saaj-hash</b></a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This is a sample application using the SAAJ API.
The Hashing service creates hash in every digest type available.
The hashes can be returned either as attachments to a SAAJ message or
within the SOAPBody depending on which option is chosen
in the radio button from the application's index.html. </p>
    </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><b>saaj/samples/uddiping</b></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This sample application is a real-time application that talks
to a live UDDI registry. It sends a <code>SOAPMessage</code> query to
the registry and prints out the message response using the SAAJ API.</p>
      <p> Instructions for running this sample are in a README file in
the <code>uddiping</code> directory.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt><b>saaj/samples/soapprocessor</b></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>This sample provides an API that implements a <code>SOAPProcessor</code>
object, which implements the processing model described in <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/#_Toc478383491">The
SOAP Message Exchange Model</a>. The sample consists of a JAR file,
which can be used by other sample applications, and the associated
source code.</p>
      <p> For more information about this sample, see the README file
in the <code>soapprocessor</code> directory.</p>
