<p>This document explains how to set up authentication in the SAAJ
reference
implementation, and how to set up HTTPS for secure message exchange.</p>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>For basic authentication, the SAAJ reference implementation uses the
<code>userInfo</code> part of the URL specification.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Set up a user for the underlying container. Java Web Services Developer
Pack users need to edit <code>&lt;<i>JWSDP_HOME</i>&gt;/conf/tomcat-users.xml</code>.</li>
  <li>Add a security constraint in <code>web.xml</code>. For example:
    <pre>  &lt;servlet&gt;<br>    &lt;servlet-name&gt;saaj.authenticated&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br>    &lt;jsp-file&gt;/echo.jsp&lt;/jsp-file&gt;<br>  &lt;/servlet&gt;<br><br>  &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;<br>    &lt;servlet-name&gt;saaj.authenticated&lt;/servlet-name&gt;<br>    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/authecho.jsp&lt;/url-pattern&gt;<br>  &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;<br><br>  &lt;security-constraint&gt;<br>    &lt;auth-constraint&gt;<br>      &lt;role-name&gt;saaj&lt;/role-name&gt;<br>    &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;<br>  &lt;/security-constraint&gt;<br><br>  &lt;login-config&gt;<br>    &lt;auth-method&gt;BASIC&lt;/auth-method&gt;<br>  &lt;/login-config&gt;<br></pre>
  </li>
  <li>The client should use the the following syntax for URLs:</li>
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/FILE</pre>
</ul>
<h3>Secure Transport</h3>
<p><b>Note:</b> Secure transport applies only to request/response
messages (those sent using the <code>SOAPConnection.call</code>
method).</p>
<p>Setting up HTTPS is a bit more difficult. The critical part is
setting
up the server certificates, required by Java Secure Socket Extension
(JSSE) in order to communicate with the server. You'll need to use the
following
commands:</p>
<pre>keytool -genkey -alias saaj-test -dname "cn=localhost" -keyalg RSA -storepass changeit<br>keytool -export -alias saaj-test -storepass changeit -file server.cer<br>keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias saaj-test -file server.cer<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -keypass changeit -storepass changeit<br></pre>
<p>The first command will generate a server certificate in your <code>$HOME/.keystore</code>.
The <code>dname</code> should be localhost (if you use localhost in
the URLs) or your hostname (where you run the server).</p>
<p>The second command will export the certificate in a file, and the
third
will import the certificate into the list of certificates the client
knows
about.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use the <code>server.cer</code> and get it
signed
by one of the certificate authorities; it will then work with any
client,
without your having to import the certificate into each client VM. Make
sure
you have added JSSE jars into the CLASSPATH, of course.&nbsp;<b></b></p>
<p>The next step is getting Tomcat in the Java WSDP to work with JSSE.
This is
documented in the Tomcat documentation that is bundled with the Java
WSDP. You
may need to uncomment the "SSL Connector" portion from the <code>server.xml</code>
file. Please follow the Tomcat documentation. For Setting up HTTPS with
the Sun Java System Application Server refer to <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/Security6.html#wp509934">http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/Security6.html#wp509934</a><b></b>
</p>
<p>Start the&nbsp; container and try a simple URL using HTTPS (like <code>https://host:8443/index.html</code>).
The browser should ask you to accept a certificate and then display the
page. If you got this to work, the server is running fine. </p>
<p>From the SAAJ side, all you need to do is use URLs with HTTPS
as the protocol. This will work <i>only</i> if the certificate was
successfully
imported into <code>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts</code>;
otherwise
JSSE will not allow the connection. </p>
