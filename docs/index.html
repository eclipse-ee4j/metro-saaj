<h3><a name="overview">SAAJ API Overview</a></h3>
<p>The
SOAP with Attachments API for Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
(SAAJ) 1.3 provides the API for creating and sending SOAP messages by
means of
the <code>jakarta.xml.soap</code> package. It is used for the SOAP
messaging that goes on behind the scenes in JAX-RPC, and JAXR
implementations. SOAP Handlers in JAX-WS use SAAJ APIs to access the
SOAP Message.&nbsp; Developers can also use it to write SOAP messaging
applications directly instead of using JAX-RPC/JAX-WS.</p>
<hr>
<b>NOTE:</b> <br>
<p>&nbsp;The
SAAJ specification is developed through the Java Community
Process following the process described at
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/procedures/overview">jcp.org</a>.
This process involves an
Expert Group with a lead that is responsible for delivering
the specification, a reference implementation (RI) and a test
compatibility kit (TCK).
The primary goal of an RI is to support the development of the
specification and to validate it. Specific RIs can have additional
goals; the SAAJ RI is a production-quality implementation that is
used directly in a number of products
by Sun and other vendors. To emphasize the quality of the
implementation we call it a <em>Standard Implementation</em>.
</p>
The SAAJ expert group has wide industry participation with Sun
Microsystems as the EG lead. The initial API was part of JAXM 1.0 in
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=67">JSR-67</a> and was
released in December 2001;
the specification was later separated from JAXM in a maintenance
release in June 2002. The <code>jakarta.xml.messaging</code> package,
defined in
the Java API for XML Messaging (JAXM) 1.1 specification, is not part of
the <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html">Java
Web Services Developer Pack</a>. The JAXM API is available as a
separate download from <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/xml/downloads/jaxm.html"><code>http://java.sun.com/xml/downloads/jaxm.html</code></a>
<hr>
<p>The SAAJ API allows a client to send messages directly to the
ultimate recipient using a <code>SOAPConnection</code> object, which
provides a point-to-point connection to the intended recipient.
Response messages
are received <i>synchronously</i> using a <i>request-response</i>
model.
<code>SOAPConnection</code> (and its related classes) is a pure library
implementation that lets you send SOAP messages directly to a remote
party. A standalone client, that is, one that does not run in a
container
such as a servlet, must include client-side libraries in its CLASSPATH.
This model is simple to get started but has limited possibilities for
reliability and message delivery guarantees. For instance, the
point-to-point message exchange model relies largely on the reliability
of the underlying transport for delivering a message.
